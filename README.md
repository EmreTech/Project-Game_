# Project-Game_

NOTE: My work is 100% virus clean. If you are not sure enough, get an anti-virus program, and scan your computer after downloading this file and my other files. But if you don't want to do that, take my word and trust me.

How to run this project:
There is another file required to run this project that is not on this repo, but on Google Drive. Link is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=18AMWdQsqJNNnujvbJT8D4g-wnMde5kLt

1. Make sure you have JRE installed. Do check this, go to Command Prompt/Terminal, and type "java --version". It should tell you the version of Java. If not, here's how to install JRE:
Go to any web browser, and type "java download". You should find a link to java.com. Just click download and agree too everything you need to agree too. Make sure you find the proper platform for your OS. To install JRE, after the download, run the installer. There are no special instructions here. Now you should be done.
2. Go to Command Prompt/Terminal, then type "cd C:\username here\path\to\downloaded folder\Project Game\res" for Windows. For Mac, type "cd /Users/username here/path/to/downloaded folder/Project Game/res".
3. Type in "java -jar Game.jar". A window with the game should be running.
