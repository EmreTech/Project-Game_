How to run this project:
1. Make sure you have JRE installed. Do check this, go to Command Prompt/Terminal, and type "java --version". It should tell you the version of Java. If not, here's how to install JRE:
Go to any web browser, and type "java download". You should find a link to java.com. Just click download and agree too everything you need to agree too. Make sure you find the proper platform for your OS. To install JRE, after the download, run the installer. There are no special instructions here. Now you should be done.
2. Go to Command Prompt/Terminal, then type "cd C:\username here\path\to\downloaded folder\Project Game\res" for Windows. For Mac, type "cd /Users/username here/path/to/downloaded folder/Project Game/res".
3. Type in "java -jar Game.jar". A window with the game should be running.
